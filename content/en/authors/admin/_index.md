I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, supervised by Prof. [Audrey Béliveau](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/a2belive/home) and Prof. [Martin Lysy](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/martin-lysy).  

My research is mainly concerned with Bayesian hierarchical modeling and is motivated by applications in a variety of fields. Currently I am working on capture-recapture studies and integrated population model. Moreover, I am interested in various problems in Bayesian methods. I am still learning more and more new areas of statistics and biostatistics.
